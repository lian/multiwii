   For PROMINI, attach sat grey to RX0.  Attach sat black to ground.  
     There is no 3.3V source on a pro mini; you can either use a different 3V source, or attach orange to 5V with a 3V regulator in-line (such as http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=MCP1700-3002E/TO-ND)
     If you use an inline-regulator, a standard 3-pin servo connector can connect to ground, +5V, and RX0; solder the correct wires (and the 3V regulator!) to a Spektrum baseRX-to-Sat cable that has been cut in half. 
     NOTE: Because there is only one serial port on the Pro Mini, using a Spektrum Satellite implies you CANNOT use the PC based configuration tool. Further, you cannot use on-aircraft serial LCD as the baud rates are incompatible. You can configure by one of two methods:
       1) Use an on-aircraft i2c LCD (such as Eagle Tree or LCD03) for setting gains, reading sensors, etc. 
       2) Available now: Comment out the Spektrum definition, upload, plug in PC, configure; uncomment the Spektrum definition, upload, plug in RX, and fly.  Repeat as required to configure.
